# Browser Automation with playwright-cli

## Resource Budget (MUST)

One Playwright browser session may be active at a time, machine-wide. The budget is shared by every worktree and by any other checkout that ships this wrapper, because the contended resource is machine RAM and CPU rather than the repository. Playwright disables normal background throttling, so a hidden bitbones page keeps doing peer-to-peer and rendering work after a check finishes.

- During iteration, use Chrome/Blink only. Run the full cross-browser matrix once the change is ready for final verification.
- Open every fresh session through `./scripts/pw-session.sh open <session> ...`; it acquires the shared browser slot.
- Reuse the same engine session for desktop and mobile by resizing it.
- Close it with `./scripts/pw-session.sh close <session>` in a finally-style cleanup before opening another engine. `close` stops the browser even when the lock was already lost, so it is always the right cleanup call.
- Run browser engines and profiler batches sequentially. Never spawn browser-driving agents in parallel.
- Exit code 75 means the slot is busy. Finish non-browser work and retry, or block on `./scripts/pw-session.sh open --wait[=SECONDS] <session> ...` (default 300s). Do not bypass the lock.
- Never use `playwright-cli close-all` or `kill-all` while concurrent agents may own sessions.
- A lock left behind by an interrupted workflow clears itself: the next `open` reclaims any slot whose browser is no longer running. Inspect the holder with `./scripts/pw-session.sh status`, which reports whether that browser is still alive. `release <session>` is a last resort for the rare case where `status` cannot verify the browser state.

## Which URL to Drive (MUST)

Automate the **plain-port** dev server, not the portless one:

```bash
PORTLESS=0 yarn start     # http://localhost:5173
```

`yarn start` on its own fronts Vite with portless over https, and that path is a bad automation target for two reasons: the hostname depends on the current git branch (a checkout on `feature/x` serves `https://feature-x.bitbones.localhost`, not `https://bitbones.localhost`), and portless presents a locally generated certificate that `playwright-cli open` has no flag to ignore. Plain-port mode has neither problem.

Resolve the URL instead of assuming it, because `scripts/local-server-utils.mjs` walks up from 5173 when that port is taken:

```bash
BITBONES_URL="${BITBONES_URL:-http://localhost:5173}"
curl -sf "$BITBONES_URL" -o /dev/null && echo "dev server OK at $BITBONES_URL" || echo "NOT RUNNING"
```

If it is not running, read the port Vite printed in its own output, or export `BITBONES_URL` yourself. If the contributor insists on driving the portless https URL, take it from the `Serving at ...` line their `yarn start` printed — never hardcode it.

Routing is `HashRouter`, so **every in-app URL needs the `#` segment**. `http://localhost:5173/settings` is a 404 from Vite; `http://localhost:5173/#/settings` is the settings view. Real routes:

| Route | View |
|---|---|
| `#/` | default feed |
| `#/catalog` | catalog of the default feed |
| `#/p/subscriptions` | subscribed communities feed |
| `#/p/subscriptions/catalog` | catalog of that feed |
| `#/p/<communityAddress>` | one community |
| `#/p/<communityAddress>/c/<commentCid>` | one post and its replies |
| `#/communities` | community list |
| `#/profile`, `#/inbox`, `#/settings`, `#/about` | account pages |
| `#/board`, `#/text-only`, `#/modal`, `#/css-switch` | experimental layout views |

## Cross-Browser UI Verification

When using `playwright-cli` to verify rendering, styling, layout, or interactions in this repo, run the relevant flow in all three major browser engines:

- `chrome` for Blink
- `firefox` for Gecko
- `webkit` for Safari/WebKit coverage

Use separate short named sessions per engine, compare the results, and record any engine-specific differences instead of treating Chromium output as sufficient. Run them sequentially:

```bash
./scripts/pw-session.sh open verify-chrome "$BITBONES_URL/#/" --browser=chrome
# Run the desktop and mobile flow, then release the slot.
./scripts/pw-session.sh close verify-chrome

./scripts/pw-session.sh open verify-firefox "$BITBONES_URL/#/" --browser=firefox
# Run the desktop and mobile flow, then release the slot.
./scripts/pw-session.sh close verify-firefox

./scripts/pw-session.sh open verify-webkit "$BITBONES_URL/#/" --browser=webkit
# Run the desktop and mobile flow, then release the slot.
./scripts/pw-session.sh close verify-webkit
```

Mobile viewport on the session that is already open:

```bash
playwright-cli -s=verify-chrome resize 375 812
playwright-cli -s=verify-chrome snapshot
```

## Setup

`playwright` is a devDependency, but `playwright-cli` itself is a global tool. Install both once per machine:

```bash
npm install -g @playwright/cli@latest
npx playwright install chromium        # add firefox webkit for the full matrix
```

`playwright-cli` writes traces, videos, and saved storage state into `.playwright-cli/`, which is git-ignored.

## Quick start

```bash
# open new browser
playwright-cli open
# navigate to a page
playwright-cli goto https://playwright.dev
# interact with the page using refs from the snapshot
playwright-cli click e15
playwright-cli type "page.click"
playwright-cli press Enter
# take a screenshot
playwright-cli screenshot
# close the browser
playwright-cli close
```

## Session mode selection

Default to a fresh isolated browser session for reproducible verification.

Before browser work where existing state may matter, explicitly confirm the mode if the user has not already said which one they want:

1. Fresh isolated `playwright-cli` session
2. Current browser session reuse

Existing state usually matters when the task depends on account keys, cookies, extensions, open tabs, or reproducing something already happening in the contributor's browser. bitbones keeps its account and subscriptions in browser storage, so a fresh session starts logged out with the default community list and no subscriptions — that is usually what you want, but say so in the report.

Do not attach to a live personal browser session without explicit approval.

If current-session reuse is requested, prefer the supported attach path in the local setup:

```bash
# Fresh isolated browser (default)
playwright-cli -s=verify open http://localhost:5173/#/

# Reusable Playwright-managed profile
playwright-cli -s=verify open http://localhost:5173/#/ --persistent

# Attach to an existing browser when the local extension bridge is set up
playwright-cli open --extension
```

If the task requires the contributor's current browser session and the attach path is not available in the current setup, stop and ask whether to switch to a fresh session or provide an explicit CDP-based Playwright script.

## Commands

### Core

```bash
playwright-cli open
# open and navigate right away
playwright-cli open https://example.com/
playwright-cli goto https://playwright.dev
playwright-cli type "search query"
playwright-cli click e3
playwright-cli dblclick e7
playwright-cli fill e5 "user@example.com"
playwright-cli drag e2 e8
playwright-cli hover e4
playwright-cli select e9 "option-value"
playwright-cli upload ./document.pdf
playwright-cli check e12
playwright-cli uncheck e12
playwright-cli snapshot
playwright-cli snapshot --filename=after-click.yaml
playwright-cli eval "document.title"
playwright-cli eval "el => el.textContent" e5
playwright-cli dialog-accept
playwright-cli dialog-accept "confirmation text"
playwright-cli dialog-dismiss
playwright-cli resize 1920 1080
playwright-cli close
```

### `eval` gotcha

`playwright-cli eval` decides whether your string is an expression or a function by looking for
`=>`. A bare expression that merely *contains* an arrow — a `.sort()` comparator, a `.map()`
callback — is misread as a function definition and fails with `TypeError: result is not a function`.
Wrap those in an explicit arrow:

```bash
# fails: the inner => makes playwright-cli treat the whole string as a function
playwright-cli eval "JSON.stringify([...document.links].map(a => a.href))"

# works
playwright-cli eval "() => JSON.stringify([...document.links].map(a => a.href))"

# also fine: no arrow anywhere
playwright-cli eval "document.title"
```

A bare top-level `await` fails the same way, with `Passed function is not well-serializable`:

```bash
# fails
playwright-cli eval "JSON.stringify(await fetch('/version.json').then(r => r.json()))"

# works
playwright-cli eval "async () => JSON.stringify(await fetch('/version.json').then(r => r.json()))"
```

The element form (`playwright-cli eval "el => el.textContent" e5`) is already a function, so it needs
no wrapper.
